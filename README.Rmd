The main objective of "Bloomers" package is to detect sharp changes in abundances for individual taxa in microbial communities. A bloomer is defined as a taxa that has a fast and significant increase in a community compared to the rest of species. Examples are given for bacteria found in the Mediterranean season. 

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EcologyR/Bloomers")
```

The code to create this package is available [here](https://github.com/EcologyR/Bloomers).

## The workflow of the bloomers package is summarized in the following graph

![](inst/shceme_bloomers_pk.png)

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# library(Bloomers)
## basic example code

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

Put here a plot representing blooming species and how we do detect anomalies

```{r plot.bloomers, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#load("./data/bloomersdata.rda")

#plot(bloomersdata$pseudoabundance) #improve this example 

```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

## Citation

If using this package, please cite it:

```{r comment=NA}
#citation("Bloomers")
```
